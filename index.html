		Care Computing Group (CCG) is a research group led by Dr. Xianghua (Sharon) Ding within the School of Computing Science at the University of Glagow. We explore interactive and collaborative computing technologies that can empower people, transform care, and enhance wellbeing. Such research is necessarily interdisciplinary, and our members are from diverse backgrounds, including computing science and engineering but also design, healthcare, psychology, automation, and more. Coming from diverse disciplines, we generally work in the areas of Human-Computer Interactions (HCI), Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Ubiquitous Computing. By conducting interdisciplinary research, often with ethnographic field work, and iterative co-design and co-development processes, we aspire to create innovative solutions that can be integrated into real practices to make real impact.
