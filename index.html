Care Computing Group (CCG) is a research group led by <a href="https://xianghuading.github.io/">Dr. Xianghua (Sharon) Ding</a>  within <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/gist-section/"> the GIST section </a> of  <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/">the School of Computing Science </a> at the University of Glagow. We explore interactive and collaborative computing that can empower people, transform care, and enhance wellbeing. Such research is necessarily interdisciplinary, and our members are from diverse backgrounds, including computing science and engineering but also design, healthcare, psychology, automation, and more. We generally work in the areas of Human-Computer Interactions (HCI), Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp), and often integrate ethnographic field work, and iterative co-design and co-development as part of our research of care computing.
